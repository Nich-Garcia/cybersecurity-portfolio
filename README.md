# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. I am an aspiring Security Analyst completing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and building hands-on skills in threat detection, system hardening, SIEM analysis, Linux security, and risk assessment.

This portfolio contains my projects, labs, homelab builds, documentation, and skill development as I transition into a full-time cybersecurity role.

## 👤 About Me

I come from a hands-on background in **construction and field operations**, where safety, risk awareness, communication, and real-world problem solving were essential every day.  
These strengths translate directly into cybersecurity:

- Identifying risks early  
- Following procedures and policies  
- Documenting incidents accurately  
- Operating under pressure  
- Protecting people, equipment, and systems  

I'm now applying those skills to:

- Security Operations  
- System Hardening  
- Incident Detection & Response  
- Threat Analysis  
- Linux & Network Security  

My goal is to grow into a **Security Analyst / SOC Analyst** role, combining technical skill with the discipline and risk mindset gained from field operations.
